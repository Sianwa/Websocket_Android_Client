# Websocket_Android_Client Overview
We decided to use an android based client for the project. 
The app was ment to emulate an online shopping cart where the recyclerview rows where the toys, and a cardview at the top shows the total cost of all toys in the cart.
Whenever the client adds the toy to the cart, the toy details are sent to the Websocket Server to calculate and return cart total to the android client.
