# Websocket_Android_Client Overview
We decided to use an android based client for the project. 
The app was ment to emulate an online shopping cart where the recyclerview rows where the toys, and a cardview at the top shows the total cost of all toys in the cart.

## Resources
The android client uses the websocket client library from: https://github.com/TakahikoKawasaki/nv-websocket-client.
